Progress log

Meeting 1
Logic code should be ok for minimum viable product on 08.02.2024
Next starting to create tests
After that GUI
Then adding more logic features

Meeting 2 
Logic code pretty much complete besides minor fixes that might occur later on
Created tests and revised them after game logic had changed a bit
NOTE: For tests, some gui variables in player.scala need to be commented out
Created an interactive gui (purchasing, placing and updating towers)
Changed game logic files quite a bit including:
    - Enemies within a wave spawning in steps
    - Enemies don't go by the same line, they are a bit transitioned 

Meeting 3
No notable progression made due to pressures from other courses
Still going according to timetable due to progression in the beginning

Meeting 4
Increased the readability of the code and added multiple comments explaining the code
Made some minor optimizations for a couple methods
Been working on a JSON parser, only tough luck so far (this has been very frustrating)
Started working on the final documentation
Plans to add a JSON parser and perhaps animating the towers' shootings, which has also been frustrating to try to do
When these are done, so am I, and the plan is to return the final document by 18.4.2024

TODO
Last tests
JSON loading
Firing animation
Configuration files?
