Progress log

Meeting 1

Logic code should be ok for minimum viable product on 08.02.2024
Next starting to create tests
After that GUI
Then adding more logic features

Meeting 2 
Logic code pretty much complete besides minor fixes that might occur later on
Created tests and revised them after game logic had changed a bit
NOTE: For tests, some gui variables in player.scala need to be commented out
Created an interactive gui (purchasing, placing and updating towers)
Changed game logic files quite a bit including:
    - Enemies within a wave spawning in steps
    - Enemies don't go by the same line, they are a bit transitioned
